# Source Code

This directory contains clean, modular implementations for CS336 projects.

## Conventions
- One model or component per file.
- Keep interfaces small and testable.
- Prefer explicit shapes and dtypes in docstrings.

## Planned Modules
- `tokenization/`: BPE and unigram tokenizers
- `models/`: transformer blocks and decoder-only stacks
- `training/`: optimizer setup, schedulers, and checkpointing
- `evaluation/`: perplexity and downstream metrics
