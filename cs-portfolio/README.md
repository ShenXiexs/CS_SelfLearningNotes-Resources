# CS Self-Learning Portfolio

This repository organizes my structured self-study curriculum across core CS areas and modern ML/LLM research. The goal is to demonstrate depth in fundamentals, solid systems intuition, and the ability to reproduce and extend contemporary research.

## Motivation
- Build a research-grade foundation across programming, algorithms, systems, and ML.
- Produce reproducible implementations, experiments, and reports suitable for PhD admissions and collaborators.
- Track a coherent learning pipeline from fundamentals to LLM-scale systems.

## Conventions (Per Course Module)
- `README.md`: scope, prerequisites, key concepts, takeaways, and research links.
- `src/`: clean, modular implementations with clear interfaces.
- `notes/`: theory summaries, proofs, and derivations.
- `experiments/`: controlled studies and ablations.
- `report/`: written summaries or PDFs.

## Learning Pipeline
The folder order mirrors a research-oriented progression: programming and data structures, algorithms, systems and operating systems, networks and databases, then ML, deep learning, NLP, and LLM systems.

## Audience
- CS PhD admissions committees
- Research collaborators
- Industry ML and systems researchers

## Status
Each module README documents progress, experiments, and next steps.
